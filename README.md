# [Coffee With Confidants](http://coffeewithconfidants.herokuapp.com/)

**Coffee With Confidants** is a meetup app for those who want to wake up, get up, and get out there! 

Unregistered site visitors can browse the list of [confabs](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/confab) posted by other [confidants](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/confidant), but to participate, a confidant must log in with existing credentials or create a new account with a username, email, and [conurbation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/conurbation) of their choice. In addition to joining the posted confabs, a logged-in confidant can play host by creating their own confab for others to join. Confidants can also edit or update their account details, including switching locations to another conurbation via the control panel.

Coffee With Confidants incorporates the core functionality and design of [Tea With Strangers](http://www.teawithstrangers.com) with just a bit of flavor from [Persona 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5).
